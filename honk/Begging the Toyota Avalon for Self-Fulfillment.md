Throughout *Honk*‘s history, we’ve spent a great while on the *why*. This truth has become more and more evident as I’ve sifted through our endless unfinished project files in my weary, somber daze.

Consciously or not, I think we’ve always known that our best hope for unique insight as car writers lay within the terrible neighborhood of cultural and psychosocial analysis – partially because we’re not getting paid, and it’s a lot of fun – but there’s another factor, too.

Each time I sit in an unfamiliar car and blab for 12+ straight hours as we dilly dather about abandoned Missouri mornings, I leave feeling as if I’ve spent the time meditating. I am now certain that I really do gain more than just entertainment and some achingly-titanic raw video files.

In the chambers of exclusively-automotive positing we construct, I have arrived upon many a precious proverb and – truthfully – why else am I alive?

**The subject of existence is not inappropriate in a conversation regarding Toyota’s flagship sedan**, which is a bit startling, isn’t it?

> I did not spec the foglights,
> 
> I will never again see clearly enough
> 
> to live with purpose.

This film is pretty crazy, if I’m honest. It’s by far the most surreal content on our channel in a very long time.

> I have thrown away
> 
> everything of substance I’ve been given.
> 
> I have become a ghost.
> 
> Weightlessly,
> 
> I steer the Avalon
> 
> through my frivolous reality.

It was Brent, though, who offered the pinnacle crux of the night:

> **It’s refined but it’s not extravagant. It’s competent, but it’s not extraordinary. It’s like driving a loaded Ford.**

I replied in kind:

“**The luxury equation is there; the aspiration isn’t**. It’s well-engineered, but that’s not enough. Luxury is an attitude, but Toyota shouldn’t be expected to understand it.”

Perhaps Keith will return one day, having healed himself and cleansed his demons.

White lives matter. Shrimp curry matters.

!["I'm deserving but I'm maybe not deserving but I'm deserving but I hate myself for being deserving, so I bought a Toyota Avalon."](https://web.archive.org/web/20160630123838im_/http://www.extratone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/avalonkiss-1024x576.png)

“I’m deserving but I’m maybe not deserving but I’m deserving but I hate myself for being deserving, so I bought a Toyota Avalon.”

Perhaps this is all nothing more than an emptyheaded joke. Maybe we’ve failed in our function as public informants. Then again, maybe it’s *you* who have failed *us.*

You are considering the purchase of a Toyota Avalon, yes, but are you real?
